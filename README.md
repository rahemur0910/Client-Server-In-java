// Server .java
This Java code represents a simple server that listens for client connections on port 12345 and echoes back any messages received from clients. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

Imports necessary Java I/O and networking classes.
Defines a class named Server.
In the main method:
Creates a ServerSocket object bound to port 12345.
Prints a message indicating that the server has started and is waiting for clients to connect.
Waits for a client to connect using the accept() method, which blocks until a client connects.
Once a client connects, it prints a message indicating the connection.
Sets up input and output streams (BufferedReader and PrintWriter) to communicate with the client.
Enters a loop to continuously read messages from the client.
For each message received, it prints the message and echoes it back to the client prepending "Server received: ".
When the client closes the connection or sends a null message, the loop terminates.
Closes all resources (BufferedReader, PrintWriter, Socket, and ServerSocket) in the finally block.

//Client.java

This Java code represents a simple client that connects to a server running on localhost (the same machine) at port 12345. Here's what the code does:

Imports necessary Java I/O and networking classes.
Defines a class named Client.
In the main method:
Creates a Socket object to connect to the server running on localhost (the same machine) at port 12345.
Sets up input and output streams (BufferedReader and PrintWriter) to communicate with the server.
Sets up a BufferedReader to read messages from the console (user input).
Enters a loop to continuously read messages from the console.
For each message read from the console:
Sends the message to the server via the output stream.
Receives a response from the server via the input stream and prints it.
The loop continues until the user closes the console input (Ctrl + D on Unix-like systems, Ctrl + Z on Windows).
Closes all resources (BufferedReader, PrintWriter, and Socket) in the finally block or when an exception occurs.
This code represents a basic implementation of a client-server interaction. Like with the server, in a real-world scenario, you may want to handle input/output in separate threads, add error handling, and implement more robust communication protocols.
